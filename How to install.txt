Eye Care App - Setup Guide
----------------------------------

To ensure the application runs correctly and the user interface displays properly, please follow these steps:

1. Install Required Python Libraries:
If you are running the source code directly, open your terminal (CMD/PowerShell) and run the following command:

pip install customtkinter screen-brightness-control plyer

2. Install the Font:
Locate the file named "Pacifico.ttf" in the folder.
- Right-click on "Pacifico.ttf".
- Select "Install" (or "Install for all users").
This is necessary for the timer and text to display in the intended stylized format.

3. System Notifications:
Ensure that "Focus Assist" or "Do Not Disturb" is turned off in Windows settings so you can receive break alerts.
